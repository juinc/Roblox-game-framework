# ALL CREDITS GO TO THE RESPECTIVE CREATORS OF THE PACKAGES USED IN THIS FRAMEWORK

# some lua framework
i made this so i could use it in my projects without having to recreate the same thing everytime
this is just a collection of multiple packages/frameworks. i just put them together so i could use them in my projects

## Getting Started
how to use overture
when you want to use a library with overture,
in the service add the tag "oLibrary" when knitinit is called to the package
now when knitStart is called you will be able to use the library
same thing goes for every tag and stuff

how to use knit
just put module scripts in the services (if you need something server sided) or in the controllers (if you need something client sided) folders
copy the format used in the other services and boom
